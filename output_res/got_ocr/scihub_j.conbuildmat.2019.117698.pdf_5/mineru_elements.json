    "text": "Fig. 7). Since the spectrum at both points 54 and 55 display high intensity, the ESEM is used to produce a single electron structure, with particular, during the soaking, the RCS was fully immersed into the NT solution. That is to say, NT articles surrounded the RCS and had the equal chance to load onto any part of RCS because no particular part of RCS was proved to have the capacity of selective adsorption. Furthermore, the ESEM and EDS were pictured ran on the surface of the ESEM. The ESEM was used to compare the RCS surface is covered by NT. Second, ROSK has a porous structure and extremely rough surface. Some NT particles are deposited and accumulated inside the pores as well as on the surface. This is proved by the porosity and pore size distribution analysis, with results in Fig. 8b. The porities of RCS and NT\\#RCBS are 29 and 26.5 \\%, respectively. The reduced porosity of NT\\#RCBS relative to RCS is due to the filling of NT after the soaking. The absolute reduction is only 2.5 \\% which echoes the limited NT loading amount measured by the analytical balance below. Furthermore, referring",
