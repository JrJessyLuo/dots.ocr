    "text": "Figure 9. This system involves four components. However, one of them is an inert system. The system is a function of the inert system assumed the same as that of the light reactant A, it is fed from the fresh feed stream F_A 0 as a mixture with A. The other fresh feed stream F_B 0 contains pure reactant B. While the heavy product C leaves the column from the bottom, the low-boling inert I is removed from the distillate without taking part in the reaction. Thus, the column has three zones: a stripping section, a reactive zone, and a rectifying section. It is assumed that the light and heavy fresh feed streams are fed from the bottom and top trays of the reactive zone.",
