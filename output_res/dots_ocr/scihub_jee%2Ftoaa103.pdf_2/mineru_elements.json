    "text": "**Fig. 1.** General schematic of the third floor of the pilot-scale flour mill used for all experiments. The black boxes, white circles, and rectangles represent large structural features on the third floor such as support columns, milling equipment, sifters, and large storage bins. The bioassay area positions are numbered 1–10. The location of each aerosol application position is denoted as A1, A2, and A3 inside the gray squares. Aerosol application 4 was released from all three locations A1, A2, and A3 (1/3 dose at each position). Source: Scheff et al. (2018), used by permission.",
