    "text": "Fig. 1 schematically shows the operation principle of an SGVC cell [4]. It can be noted that it has a floating body where holes are accumulated for memory effects. To verify memory cell operation, 2-D device simulation was performed. We used ATLAS as a simulator. Excess holes are generated by impact ionization in this simulation. Simulated parameters are listed in Table I. The difference in the body potential of each state and the $I_D - V_G$ characteristics were extracted first, in order to show the accumulation of holes in the body of the SGVC cell. Fig. 2 shows a comparison of the hole potential between “1” state and reference state ($V_{gate} = 0, V_{source} = 0, V_{drain} = 0$). In the case of state “1,” through impact ionization in the high field region near the drain, excess holes are injected into the body and then the body potential increases. Fig. 3 shows $I_d - V_g$ characteristics of the SGVC cell. The drain current of “1” state is larger than that of “0” state. This is due to the increase of the body potential when holes are accumulated into the body through writing operation, hence lowering the threshold voltage, which in turn increases the drain current. Subsequently, the drain current as a function of time was extracted to show",
